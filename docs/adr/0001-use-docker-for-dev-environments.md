# ADR-0001: Use Docker for Development Environments

Date: 2024-01-15
Status: Accepted
Deciders: Development Team
Tags: docker, architecture, isolation

## Context

We were experiencing several problems with traditional development environments:
- 90+ global VS Code extensions causing conflicts and crashes
- Dependency conflicts between projects
- "Works on my machine" syndrome
- Difficult onboarding for new developers
- Inconsistent environments across team members

## Decision

We will use Docker containers for all development environments, with each project having its own isolated container managed through VS Code Dev Containers.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Isolation**: Each project has its own dependencies and extensions
- **Reproducibility**: Same environment for all developers
- **Fast onboarding**: New developers productive in minutes
- **Resource efficiency**: Reduced from 240MB to 80MB RAM for VS Code
- **Version control**: Environment configuration in source control

### Negative
- **Learning curve**: Developers need Docker knowledge
- **Initial setup time**: Building containers takes time
- **Storage overhead**: Multiple container images
- **Performance**: Slight overhead on macOS/Windows

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Virtual Machines** - Too heavy, slow startup
2. **WSL2 only** - Windows-specific, not cross-platform
3. **Nix/NixOS** - Steep learning curve, limited tooling
4. **Continue with global** - Escalating conflicts and issues

## Implementation

- Docker Compose for orchestration
- VS Code Dev Containers extension
- Template-based project initialization
- Automated container builds in CI/CD

## Validation

Success metrics after 3 months:
- 0 environment-related bugs
- 75% reduction in setup time
- 90% developer satisfaction
