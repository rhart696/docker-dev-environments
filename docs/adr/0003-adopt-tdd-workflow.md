# ADR-0003: Adopt Test-Driven Development Workflow

Date: 2024-01-15
Status: Accepted
Deciders: Development Team, Architecture Team
Tags: testing, tdd, quality, process

## Context

Based on analysis of "How to Reduce 90% of Errors with Claude Code" and our current error rates:
- 45 runtime errors per 1000 lines of code
- 35% of development time spent debugging
- 23% integration failure rate
- Low test coverage (45% average)
- Frequent regression bugs

The video demonstrated that strict TDD with AI assistance can reduce errors by 90%.

## Decision

We will adopt strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow with:
1. **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle** enforcement
2. **Test-first requirement** - No code without tests
3. **Minimum 80% coverage** threshold
4. **Automated enforcement** via Claude Hooks
5. **Natural language testing** with Stagehand

## Consequences

### Positive
- **90% error reduction** based on empirical evidence
- **Better design** - Tests drive architecture
- **Living documentation** - Tests document behavior
- **Confidence in changes** - Regression prevention
- **Faster debugging** - Issues caught immediately

### Negative
- **Initial slowdown** - 15-20% slower at start
- **Learning curve** - Team needs TDD training
- **Resistance to change** - Developers may resist
- **Test maintenance** - Tests need updates too

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Test-After Development** 
   - Doesn't catch design issues early
   - Lower coverage in practice
   
2. **BDD Only**
   - Good for features, misses unit level
   - Slower feedback loop
   
3. **No Enforcement**
   - Relies on discipline
   - Inconsistent application
   
4. **Manual Testing Focus**
   - Slow and error-prone
   - Not scalable

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Week 1)
- Claude Hooks for enforcement
- Stagehand integration
- Coverage tooling

### Phase 2: Training (Week 2)
- TDD workshops
- Pair programming sessions
- Example workflows

### Phase 3: Rollout (Week 3-4)
- Start with new features
- Gradually add tests to legacy code
- Monitor metrics

### Enforcement Mechanisms

1. **Pre-commit hooks** - Block untested code
2. **CI/CD gates** - Fail builds below 80% coverage
3. **Claude Hooks** - Prevent code generation without tests
4. **PR reviews** - Require test evidence

## Success Metrics

After 3 months:
- Error rate < 5 per 1000 LOC (from 45)
- Debug time < 10% (from 35%)
- Coverage > 80% (from 45%)
- Integration failures < 5% (from 23%)
