# Architecture Decision Records

This project uses Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document important architectural decisions.

## Quick Start

Create a new ADR:
```bash
./scripts/create-adr.sh "Title of Your Decision"
```

## Why ADRs?

- Document the context and consequences of decisions
- Help new team members understand the project's evolution
- Prevent repeating past mistakes
- Create a decision trail for auditing

## ADR Status

- **Proposed**: Under discussion
- **Accepted**: Decision made and implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR

## Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-0001](0001-initial-architecture.md) | Initial Architecture | Accepted | $(date +%Y-%m-%d) |
EOF

# Create first ADR for the project
cat > "$ADR_DIR/0001-initial-architecture.md" << EOF
# ADR-0001: Initial Architecture

Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
Status: Accepted
Deciders: Development Team
Tags: architecture, setup

## Context

Setting up a new project with consistent development practices and containerized environment.

## Decision

We will use:
- Docker for development environment isolation
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) for quality assurance
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for decision tracking
- Automated tooling for consistency

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent development environment across team
- High code quality through TDD
- Clear decision history
- Reduced onboarding time

### Negative
- Initial setup complexity
- Learning curve for new practices

## Implementation

1. Docker Dev Container configuration
2. TDD hooks and automation
3. ADR structure and tooling
4. CI/CD integration

## Validation

- All developers can start working within 30 minutes
- Test coverage > 80%
- All significant decisions documented
